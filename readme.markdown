# Algorithms

 Push up a solution, or two or three. Could be O(N2) or linear. More algorithm challengs to follow.
 
 ###  Non Matching Ranges
  
  Find all non-matching index ranges of a substring within a string.
  
  Given:
  ```ruby
  partial term: 'eg'
  full term: 'eggwhites eggnog'
  ```
The output should be: `[[2, 9], [12, 15]]`
